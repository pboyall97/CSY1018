    <footer class="footer">
      Studying at the University of Northampton, I am in my second year of the 4-year computing course. During my time at university I have joined the committee of a sports team as their promotional officer. Utilising my skills developed on the computing course to help promote the team online, as well as to coordinate our physical promotion presence.

      This website is a submission piece for CSY 1018 â€“ Website Development. This module provides a combination of coding and design.
      
      Before coming to university, I had no formal qualifications in the sphere of computing or IT, however throughout my childhood I was fascinated with engineering, with a specific interest in technology.
