        CSY1018 - Web Development <br><br>
        Over the course of this module, I have been taught the basic levels of CSS and HTML, enough to begin to
        create a simple website such as this one. We began by learning the very basics of each language, focusing
        on using the correct key words and proper syntax. After this, we then stepped up our understanding, adding
        extra techniques to our repertoire such as CSS transitions knowledge of Flexbox use. <br><br>
        The second half of the module focused on design and performance, learning about the features that make a 
        website appealing, such as a simplistic, easy to read design, and ease of life features such as a navigation
        bar. Whilst also teaching us how to compress images to help improve performance, outlining the tools to assess
        the website's performance and discover ways of improving even further.

        Course Assistance - Slack <br><br>
        Throughout this module, we have utilised the social platform 'slack' as quick and efficient method of
        communication, both between coursemates, and a direct link to our module tutor. This was a useful tool throughout
        this year, helping to organise meet ups with coursemates to discuss ideas and help each other. As well as pose
        any quires I may have had, to the group, 100% assisting my learning this year.
